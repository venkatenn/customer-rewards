#### **Problem Description:**
A retailer offers a reward program to its customers awarding points based on each recorded
purchase as follows. For every dollar spent over $50 on the transaction, the customer receives one point. In addition, for every dollar spent over $100, the customer receives another point.

Ex: for a $120 purchase, the customer receives
(120 - 50) x 1 + (120 - 100) x 1 = 90 points

**Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points
earned for each customer per month and total.**
